    ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Padma, a 4th year Statistics PhD student.
    ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in the topological data analysis and its applications to neuroscience and neuroimaging data.
    ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently exploring the applications of Mapper algorithm to fMRI data analysis.
    ğŸ”­ I write blog posts evolving understanding of TDA, statistics, and neuroimaging data analysis on [my website](https://t-padma.github.io/).
